prep: create CSV with subjects and file locations
  a) Add PCA and subj_id columns
DONE1. Linear reg image to template space, apply to manual seg
  a) provide CSV of locations
  b) Write a text (or csv) in the right order of IDs, with their dyspl.
scores
DONE  b) apply reg and extract CRB
DONE 2. Prep crb: extract CRB from pre-registered ALBERT seg and binarize
DONE 3. prep data set: stack CRBs and append vector of classifiers (binarize images?)
4. NN: customize network class
DONE a) Change classes to take 3D maps
DONE b) Need: max_pool_3D, filter_shape needs new dimension 
   c) Add L1 Norm (plus option in inputs)
5. Running: Read a .json with the options (to save results and have record)
   plot training error (in real time?)
   Grid or random search on validation set
   create stand alone class to run existing Net on a new subject
6. Project layers onto template space as heat map?

?. Monitor progress, maybe HTML?


REG:
First, reg brain to PCA template (apply to manual seg)
Then: reg that to oldest template (apply to manual seg)
Then: extract CRB and reg that to template CRB
